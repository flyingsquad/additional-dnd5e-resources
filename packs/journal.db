I've tried to make them more consistent with the Players Handbook, while not making crafting too trivial or too difficult.</em></p><p>The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula (see @UUID[.7Dc4k1rGeiSRfdBZ]{Magic Item Formulas}) that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast magic missile. That same character could make a +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular spell required.</p><p>Certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, you might need alchemist's supplies to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a flame tongue might require that the weapon be forged with lava.</p><p>Crafting Magic Items</p><table><thead><tr><th>Item Rarity</th><th>Creation Cost</th><th>Creation Time</th><th>Minimum Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common</td><td>100 gp</td><td>4 days</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon</td><td>500 gp</td><td>20 days</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Rare</td><td>5,000 gp</td><td>200 days</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>Very rare</td><td>50,000 gp</td><td>2,000 days</td><td>11th</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary</td><td>500,000 gp</td><td>20,000 days</td><td>17th</td></tr></tbody></table><p>@UUID[.22qBGagNbx0GOh6P]{Consumable items} and @UUID[.O49xjBvR1T30dBHU]{potions of healing} have different costs.</p><p>An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table. A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp.</p><p>If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's level for each day of the creation process. The spell's material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a spell scroll, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item's creation.</p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item (except for scrolls) if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.</p><p>While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" of the Player's Handbook).</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Spell Scrolls","type":"text","_id":"teq5WVJK5Agvnp9n","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards.

Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again.

When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied.
